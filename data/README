opinionRoleLexicon.defaultRules.txt
Zurich Sentiment lexicon enriched with default rules for opinion source/target extraction.
There is one rule for each part of speech, i.e. verbs, nouns and adjectives.
There is also a type mwe, for multi-word expressions.
The words in the expression should be separated by an underscore.
!If a source or target edge is unknown, do not leave it blank, but use a hyphen instead.
e.g. lange_Gesichter_machen[mwe][subj][-] and NOT: lange_Gesichter_machen[mwe][subj][]
