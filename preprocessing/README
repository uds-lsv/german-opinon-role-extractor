In this subdirectory you find information on the preprocessing by NLP tools that is necessary in order to run the system.

We support an installation script.
You find more information about that in subdirectory:
install_script

Since the installation script has only been tested under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and may no longer work if websites / git repositories of the tools change; we provide more detailed installation instructions for manual installation of the individual tools in subdirectory:
preprocessing_script

We support a shell-script which runs all NLP tools to do the preprocessing expected by our system.
You find more information about that in subdirectory:
